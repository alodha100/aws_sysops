AWS Elastic Beanstalk helps to quickly deploy and manage applications in the cloud without 
having to worry about the instrastructure that runs those applications.

EB reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control

EB enables automated instrastructure management and code deployment, by simply uploading for applications and includes :


1. Application Platform Managment
2. Capacity Provisioning 
3. Load Balancing
4. AutoScaling
5. Code Deployment
6. Health Monitoring

Once an application code is uploaded, EB automatically launches an environment, creates and configures the AWS resources needed to run the code.

AWS resources launched by EB are fully accessible i.e. EC2 instance can be sshed into 

Elastic Beanstalk provides developers and systems administrators an easy, fast way to deploy and manage the applications without having to worry about AWS instrastructure.
